The issue was resolved by correcting the typographical error in the wp-settings.php file. The server was then restarted to apply the changes, restoring website functionality.  
### Corrective Actions:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following corrective actions will be implemented:
 * **Enhanced Code Review**: Strengthen the code review process for all configuration files and scripts, with a particular focus on catching typos and syntax errors.
 * **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing to validate the integrity of critical configuration files before deployment.
 * **Monitoring and Alerting**: Enhance server monitoring to detect and alert administrators of any errors promptly.
 * **Backup and Restore**: Ensure regular backups of website files and configurations to enable quick restoration in case of similar issues.
## Conclusion:
